# Extension Icon

This extension currently uses default VS Code icon placeholders.

To add proper icons:

1. Create PNG files:
   - `icons/restrict-light.png` (16x16, 32x32, 128x128)
   - `icons/restrict-dark.png` (16x16, 32x32, 128x128)

2. Update package.json icon references

The icon should represent:
- The functional programming nature of Restrict Language
- The WebAssembly target
- The affine type system concept
- Modern, clean design

Suggested design elements:
- Lambda symbol (λ) for functional programming
- Geometric shapes suggesting type safety
- Rust-inspired color scheme (orange/red)
- Clean, modern look
